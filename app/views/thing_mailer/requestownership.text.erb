// Filename: "app/views/thing_mailer/reminder.text.erb" 
// Description: This file is where I created the custom message that is sent to the user upon clicking the

Hello <%= @user.name.split.first %>,

<%= @from_user %> is requesting ownership of the fire hydrant you adopted at <%= @thing.street_address %>. 

If you would like to give up ownership, visit the app and choose "Abandon" to free up the hydrant. If not, please disregard this message.

Thanks!

The Adopt-a-Hydrant Team
